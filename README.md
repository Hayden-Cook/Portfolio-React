# Portfolio-React

## Description
To showcase the skills I have learned about React, I built a portfolio of past projects that I have completed. In order to complete this portfolio, I created a new project using vite. I hope this portfolio will set me apart from other developers and increase my chances of working with fellow developers and collaborating on new projects.
